The files included in this repository constitute a toolset for working with Tarski, a WordPress theme (http://tarskitheme.com). Hopefully they will prove useful to someone. List of files follows.

# Rakefile
Some Rake tasks to tag releases, create zip archives, and update a version feed.

# lib/tarski_version.rb
Generates a version feed. Plugins mostly live in the WP plugin repository now, and get update notification for free, but since 1) themes don't get this and 2) update notification wasn't in WP core when I did it, I rolled my own.

# conf/version_data.yml
Dummy configuration for the version feed generator.
