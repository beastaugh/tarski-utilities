# Tarski Utilities

The files included in this repository constitute a toolset for working with [Tarski](http://tarskitheme.com/ "An elegant, flexible WordPress theme"), a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) theme. Hopefully they will prove useful to someone.

## Files

  * __Rakefile__: some Rake tasks to tag and branch releases, create zip archives, generate an HTML version of the changelog file and update a version feed.
  * __lib/tarski_version.rb__: generates a version feed. Plugins mostly live in the WP plugin repository now, and get update notification for free, but since themes don't get this and update notification wasn't in WP core when I did it, I rolled my own.
  * __conf/version.yml__: a configuration file for the version feed generator.
  * __conf/changelog-structure.html__: a wrapper for the HTML generated by the changelog task.

## Required Gems

These tools are written in Ruby, so they require the RubyGems packaging system and the following gems:

  * [__Rake__](http://http://rake.rubyforge.org/ "Rake: Ruby Make"): to run the tasks.
  * [__YAML__](http://www.yaml.org/ "YAML: YAML Ain't Markup Language"): reader and writer for the YAML file format, needed to read the config file. _Part of the Ruby standard library_.
  * [__Builder__](http://builder.rubyforge.org/): programmatic XML generation, required to create the Tarski version feed.
  * [__BlueCloth__](http://www.devEiate.org/projects/BlueCloth "A Ruby impelementation of Markdown"): Markdown format reader and writer, used to read Tarski's changelog file.
  * [__Hpricot__](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ "A fast and delightful HTML parser"): DOM scripting in Ruby for HTML and XML, used to parse the Tarski changelog and generate a list of links to each version's entry in the changelog.
  * [__open-uri__](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/): A wrapper for some other libraries which provide network protocol access, used to read remote files where necessary. _Part of the Ruby standard library_.
